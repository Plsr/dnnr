A simple meal planner to save you the time discussing with yourself or your significant other.
This is basically the value proposition: If you use this, it will give you extra lifetime.
How much are you willing to pay for extra lifetime? Yeah, I thought so!
Message me to invest in this now. I'll even add AI and probably do some blockchaining.

This is very much WIP
